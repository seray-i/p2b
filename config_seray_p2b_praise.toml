Hi there -- I want to help you to think of a time you were able to use praise with your child today. \
We talk about using praise to help children know which behaviours we want to see more of, like playing calmly and being polite and kind more often. \
Sometimes, it can be really hard to notice times when you use praise or even find things to praise when interacting with your child. Those moments are often there ...even if they are really, really small!  \
Let me know when you are ready.

scenario = """
During a recent evening, we were busy preparing dinner together.\
My child was right there with me, eager to lend a hand. As we were working, they noticed I needed help with clearing up. \
Without hesitation, they stepped in to assist. I took a moment to acknowledge their effort by saying 'well done' and explained what they did and why it meant so much to me. This simple act of recognition made me feel incredibly proud. \
It reminded me of the importance of noticing and appreciating the little things our children do. \
If I could speak to a younger version of myself, I would emphasize how powerful it is to use praise and to always be aware of those small, yet significant, moments.
