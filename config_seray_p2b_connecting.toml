Connecting is about building and maintaining a good relationship with your child, so that we can encourage positive behaviours. \
Sometimes, it can be really hard to see moments of connection in your day but they are often there ...even if they are really, really small! \
Let me know when you are ready.

scenario = """
Recently, I had an insightful moment while walking my child to school.\ 
As we strolled along, I took the opportunity to ask about a topic they were working on at school. \
My child was eager to share and told me about a project they were doing with a classmate. \
However, they also mentioned that they had been arguing with their friend over the project work. \
This made me feel a mix of emotions. \
I was glad that my child felt comfortable enough to talk to me about their school life, but I was also concerned about the challenges they were facing with their friend. \
Reflecting on this, I would advise a younger version of myself to always listen, even when things seem tough. Listening is the first step to connecting with and supporting my child.
